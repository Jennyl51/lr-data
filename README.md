# lr-data

##Set up instructions
1. Download the data files from City of Berkeley Police Deparment Data Portal: https://bpd-transparency-initiative-berkeleypd.hub.arcgis.com/search or from the Data.zip shared in #lumenroute Slack Channel

2. Move the Data.zip to lr-data directory, and unzip the Data.zip

3. Make sure the datasets and csv file's names are matching with the shared code, please revise the name of the files on your local laptop instead of modifying the written code.
